# Quickstart: Memory-Camera Logic Quality

## Baseline

Run before adding new memory-camera audit checks:

```bash
pnpm audit:curriculum
```

Observed current baseline before this slice:

```json
{
  "math": 110,
  "logic": 316,
  "totalGames": 33,
  "totalRounds": 426,
  "mathTargetMet": true,
  "logicTargetMet": true,
  "problemCount": 0,
  "problems": []
}
```

## Red Audit

After adding memory-camera checks but before rewriting content:

```bash
pnpm audit:curriculum
```

Expected red result: command exits non-zero with targeted
`logic-memory-camera` findings for rounds whose success, retry, or parent
prompts do not consistently name remembered cards, answer, absence/exclusion,
or left-to-right order.

Observed red result after adding the audit checks:

```json
{
  "math": 110,
  "logic": 316,
  "totalGames": 33,
  "totalRounds": 426,
  "mathTargetMet": true,
  "logicTargetMet": true,
  "problemCount": 36
}
```

## Content And Voice Validation

After rewriting `logic-memory-camera` content:

```bash
pnpm audit:curriculum
pnpm export:voice-lines
pnpm generate:edge-voices -- --voice zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural --rate -12% --pitch +2Hz --python ./local-tts/.venv/bin/python --quiet --retries 3
pnpm audit:curriculum
```

Expected outcome: the audit reports `problemCount: 0` after voice generation.

## Final Validation

Before checkpointing:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm audit:curriculum
git diff --check
```

Expected outcome: all commands exit `0`.
